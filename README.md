# Practice-C-Language
This project is a C programming learning project that I implemented myself, based on the book "Sukkiri Wakaru C Language Nyumon" ("Clear and Simple Introduction to C Language").
The original source code from the book was not used directly; instead, the project was independently created using the ideas and structure presented in the book as a reference.

I appriciate you when you give me your feedbacks.
